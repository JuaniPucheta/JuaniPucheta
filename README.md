## Hi!😁 welcome to my profile!


I'm **Juan Ignacio Pucheta**. 23 years old Advanced Systems Engineering student (Final Project left, my last career's subject) from UTN FRRo (📍Argentina)

#### 📚 Here are some projects that it highlight during my bachelor's degree:
- 🏢 **IT Project Management for a Multinational Company**. Together with my work group I've made: analyze the implementation of IS&IT solutions in an Organization, describe the IS&IT requirements, complete the Contingency, Recovery and Business Continuity Plan spreadsheet according to risks on assets, prepare Project Charter, WBS, RFI, Gantt Chart and a procurement contract.
- 👪 **Simulation of people flow control systems**. With my work group we have simulated a conglomeration of people in reduced spaces, proposing structural alternatives for people to exit as quickly and safely as possible. 

#### 🖥️ Software development projects
- 📈 **M/M/1 simulation system**: Programmed in Python as the main code and represented graphically (in 3D) using AnyLogic software. See it [here](https://github.com/Luchoragusa/Simulacion/tree/main/TP-3/MM1).
- 📋 **Registration system for university courses**: I have participated in the programming in Visual Studio C++ of a registration system for subjects, taking into account quotas, schedules, days, commissions, teachers, and other relationships, for the .NET subject of the university.. See it [here](https://github.com/Luchoragusa/TP-Final-.NET).
- 🖱️ **UCP GTA in JAVA**: I have worked in a group for the development of an application similar to the UCP GTA of the video game Grand Theft Auto, developed in Eclipse IDE using Dynamic Web Project and JSP. See it [here](https://github.com/Luchoragusa/UCP).
- 🛒 **Videogames' Store**: I have worked in a group for the development fullstack of an application similar to the Steam. NodeJS, Angular and MySQL have been used. See it [here](https://github.com/Luchoragusa/MachineStore-Front).
- 📝 **My portfiolo**: my personal portfolio about my experience, education, some projects, skills..., anyway, some information about me 🤓. See it [here](https://jipucheta.netlify.app/)

#### 📖 What I'm learning and doing by this moment...
- More about coding, specially frontend.
- German at the UTN FRRo Language Center, and also by my own.
- Working on the analysis, documentation, planning and prototyping of real projects (a hardware store, an agricultural laboratory, etc.).
- Agile methodologies.
